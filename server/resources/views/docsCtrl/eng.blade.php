    <h3>WELCOME to SHF - Chào Đồng Bào</h3>
    <p>I think we was all in situation like this. It is 1PM, you are so hungry, weather is crazy bad: hot, raining, snow, etc. You don't want to go out, but you have to :(. Don't worry, I'm here to help :D</p>
    <p>So how SHF can solve it? Its idea is very simple, one person will go out and buy all stuffs others need, and he(she) will gain some point. And then he(she) can use the point to make request for other to buy his(her) stuffs.</p>
    
    <h3>so How To Use</h3>
    <p>First: Register!</p>
    <p>After that, you still cannot buy or request yet, you have to fill other information like <strong>room number</strong> or <strong>a picture that in front of your door</strong> and you are ready to go!</p>
    <p>Now you are in the system. You can find stuffs you want to buy or create a new one(but make sure make it clear enough that everyone can understand)</p>
    <p>If you want to buy more than 5 stuffs, you HAVE TO GO BY YOURSELF, and don't forget to take some others' order with you and gain some points. (Limit amount might change in the future)</p>
    <p>More features is in developing</p>
    <p>And finally, <strong class="text-danger">DO NOT CHEAT, PLAY FAIR</strong></p>
